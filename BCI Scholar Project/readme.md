# Beef Cattle Institute Scholar Project
This is my *first contribution to any research ever*. Also, my *first use of Python, ever*.

I was one of 8 scholars chosen by the Beef Cattle institute to participate in a program to "collaborate with different departments across the university to provide new resources for beef producers and veterinarians."

###### Here's a nice pic of all of us posing like the good students we are.

The purpose of this project is to use a database of x-y coordinates of 70 calves to determine when they contacted (closer than a foot to each other)
The MySQL database stored in the CISLinux server at Kansas State University contains data corresponding to every second from 2016-05-07 00:00:00 to 2016-05-27 02:59:59  for every calf
70 Calves * 86400 seconds * 20 days =~ 120 Million rows of data

I will keep adding features as time allows.
